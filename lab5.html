        Visual Appeal: Transforms plain HTML into engaging and visually pleasing webpages.
        Separation of Concerns: Keeps the design (CSS) distinct from the content (HTML), making your website easier to manage and update.
        Responsive Design: Enables websites to adapt beautifully to different screen sizes and devices (like desktops, tablets, and phones), crucial for today's diverse internet usage.
        Performance: Well-structured CSS can contribute to faster page loading times, improving user experience and even positively impacting Google search rankings.
